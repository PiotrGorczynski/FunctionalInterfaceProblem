<p align="center"> Program solves followed problem: </p>
<p align="justify"> <b> Write</b> a program where: 

*  You define a Producer class that can provide implementations functional interfaces such as: Supplier, Consumer and Function. Implement each of them of the mentioned functional interfaces using lambdas and perform a dedicated one on them method for them. 
* Create a Transformer class that can return implementations of functional interfaces (Function, UnaryOperator), which will allow us to transform data in the .map() methods that are availablein the optional class.
* Finally, create a MyConsumer class that defines methods that can take arguments functional interfaces such as: Consumer, Supplier and Function, and then print on the screen
the values returned by methods called on these functional interfaces. </p>
