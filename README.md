# <p align="center"> Functional Interface Problem </p>
<p align="center"> Program solves followed problem: </p>
<p align="justify"> 

*  Producer can provide implementations of functional interfaces such as: Supplier, Consumer and Function. There are implementations of functional interfaces using lambdas and it is showed performance a dedicated one and dedicated one method on them.
* Transformer can return implementations of functional interfaces (Function, UnaryOperator), which will allow us to transform data in the .map() methods that are available in the optional class.
* Finally, MyConsumer defines methods that can take arguments functional interfaces such as: Consumer, Supplier and Function, and then prints on the screen
the values returned by methods called on these functional interfaces. </p>

<p align="center"> The program is generally a demonstration of understanding individual functional interfaces and functional interfaces in Java. </p>
